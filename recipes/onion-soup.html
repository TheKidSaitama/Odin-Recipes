    <h1>Onion Soup Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p><em>French onion soup is a soup usually based on meat stock and onions, and often served gratinéed with croutons or a larger piece of bread covered with cheese floating on top.</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cups sliced onions</li>
        <li>5 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dry sherry</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter with olive oil in an 8-quart stock pot over medium heat. Add onions and continually stir until tender and translucent. Do not brown the onions. </li>
        <li>Add beef broth, sherry, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Let simmer for 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Ladle soup into oven-safe serving bowls and place one slice of bread on top of each (bread may be broken into pieces if you prefer). Layer each slice of bread with a slice of provolone, 1/2 slice diced Swiss and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. </li>
        <li>Place bowls on a cookie sheet and broil in the preheated oven until cheese bubbles and browns slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. </li>
